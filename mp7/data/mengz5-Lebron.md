Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers already had 3 : 3 in the previous 6 games of the 2018-2019 NBA Finals. Whether Lebron James can bring a champion or not for Lakers depends on if he can win the last game. Now the last game of this series only has one minute left, and the Warriors gets one point ahead with 100 : 99. The ball is in the hands of James, and he has four choices : he can pass the ball to his teammate Lonzo, he can do a three point shot, he can make some space and play 1 on 1 with Durant, or he will lose the ball because he is not very focused.
